# ``AlignKit``

A Layer 2 framework for NSLayoutConstraint which streamlines constraint Management in UIKit

## Overview

AlignKit is a powerful and intuitive layout framework designed to provide a more manageable and expressive way to handle Auto Layout constraints. It offers a robust yet straightforward API that enables defining, updating, and animating UI constraints with precision, reducing the boilerplate code commonly associated with UIKit's Auto Layout system.

AlignKit goes beyond standard constraint handling by introducing modular, composable functions that allow for highly readable and chainable syntax. Complex layouts can be created with minimal code, thanks to AlignKitâ€™s support for features like conditional constraints, animations, and alignment configurations, which are not typically available in other frameworks like SnapKit. With clear debug output and an organized approach to managing view hierarchies, AlignKit also streamlines troubleshooting and refinement processes during development.

From simple alignment adjustments to sophisticated layout updates, AlignKit provides fine-grained control over both the positioning and behavior of views within apps. Leveraging AlignKit allows for the creation of highly dynamic, adaptive layouts while maintaining clarity in code and functionality, making it an ideal solution for building scalable and maintainable UI in iOS applications.
