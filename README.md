# AlignKit

A Layer 2 framework for NSLayoutConstraint which streamlines constraint Management in UIKit

## Overview

![Alt text](Sources/Documentation/AlignKit.docc/Resources/Logo.png)


AlignKit is a powerful and intuitive layout framework designed to provide a more manageable and expressive way to handle Auto Layout constraints. It offers a robust yet straightforward API that enables defining, updating, and animating UI constraints with precision, reducing the boilerplate code commonly associated with UIKit's Auto Layout system.

AlignKit goes beyond standard constraint handling by introducing modular, composable functions that allow for highly readable and chainable syntax. Complex layouts can be created with minimal code, thanks to AlignKitâ€™s support for features like conditional constraints, animations, and alignment configurations, which are not typically available in other frameworks like SnapKit. With clear debug output and an organized approach to managing view hierarchies, AlignKit also streamlines troubleshooting and refinement processes during development.

From simple alignment adjustments to sophisticated layout updates, AlignKit provides fine-grained control over both the positioning and behavior of views within apps. Leveraging AlignKit allows for the creation of highly dynamic, adaptive layouts while maintaining clarity in code and functionality, making it an ideal solution for building scalable and maintainable UI in iOS applications.

# Getting Started

Streamlining layout constraints has never been easier thanks to AlignKit. This powerful framework allows you to manage your constraints with a clean and intuitive API, while delivering un-compromised performance that matches Apple's native NSLayoutConstraints.

## Usage

First, import the AlignKit framework into your project:

```swift
import AlignKit
```

### Adding Constraints

Applying constraints with AlignKit is a breeze. Simply select the UIElement you want to constrain, and use the `alk.makeConstraints` method to define your layout:

```swift
button.alk.makeConstraints { frame in
    frame.center.equalToSuperview()
    frame.size.equalTo(200)
}
```

Adding relative constraints have just got easier, use the `relativeTo` modifier:

```swift
button.alk.makeConstraints { frame in
    frame.size.equalTo(90)
    frame.trailing.equalToSuperview()
    frame.bottom.relativeTo(buttonOne.anchor.top).inset(16)
}
```

### Updating and Removing Constraints

Updating existing constraints is equally straightforward with `alk.updateConstraints`:

```swift
button.alk.updateConstraints { frame in
    frame.width.height.equalTo(200)
}
```

And if you need to remove constraints, use the `alk.removeConstraints` method:

```swift
button.alk.removeConstraints { frame in
    frame.width.equalTo(200)
}
```

> [!Warning]
> Updating or Removing a constraint which is not added to element will cause assertionFailure

ðŸ“Œ This document is a guide that explains how to use AlignKit. You can also checks the AlignKit's [API documentation](https://alignkit-gokulnairs-projects.vercel.app/documentation/alignkit).

### Utility Methods

AlignKit also provides handy utility methods to assist with debugging and optimization:

| API | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `debugPrintIf(_:_:)` | Debug prints the constraints in readble format along with the prefix, for a desired condtion |
| `debugPrintWith(_:)` | Debug prints the constraints in readble format along with the prefix |
| `animateWith(_:)` | Animate constraint changes with the provided time interval |
| `applyIf(_:)` | Apply constraints on if the provided condition succeeds |

With AlignKit, you get the power of NSLayoutConstraints combined with a modern, developer-friendly API. 
You can use these modifiers instantly after chaining the `` UIKit/UIView/alk `` DSL.

> [!Note]
> AlignKit have a auto constraint sanitiser which sanitises constraints applied on any view by removing redundant constraints provided.

## AlignKit's principles and philosophy

* AlignKit layouting is is simple, powerful and fast.
* AlignKit intention is to optimise the usage technique of NSLayoutConstraints. 
* AlignKit syntax is concise and chainable.
* AlignKit is incredibly fast, it's as faster as NSLayoutConstraints. See Performance.
* The source code for chaining syntaxes are very much similar to SnpKit
  
NOTE: Being very familiar with SnapKit, we have kept AlignKit syntanxes to be as similar as SnapKit(Along with some improved synatxes). 

## AlignKit's Perfomance 

Through performance testing, we've found that AlignKit is able to match the impressive results of NSLayoutConstraints, while providing a significantly more modern and intuitive API for developers to work with. In fact, our analysis has shown that AlignKit outperforms the leading market alternative, SnapKit, by an impressive 50% in frames per second (FPS) and 5% reduction in CPU utilization.

Enjoy the benefits of a clean, streamlined approach to managing your layout constraints, without compromising on the performance. AlignKit truly offers the best of both worlds, empowering you to build fast, efficient, and visually stunning iOS apps.
